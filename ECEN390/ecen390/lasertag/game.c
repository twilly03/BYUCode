// This game supports two teams, Team-A and Team-B.
// Each team operates on its own configurable frequency.
// Each player has a fixed set of lives and once they
// have expended all lives, operation ceases and they are told
// to return to base to await the ultimate end of the game.
// The gun is clip-based and each clip contains a fixed number of shots
// that takes a short time to reload a new clip.
// The clips are automatically loaded.
// Runs until BTN3 is pressed.
void game_twoTeamTag(void) {
  uint16_t hitCount = 0;
  runningModes_initAll();

  // Configuration...

  // Implement game loop...

  // End game loop...
  interrupts_disableArmInts(); // Done with game loop, disable the interrupts.
  hitLedTimer_turnLedOff();    // Save power :-)
  runningModes_printRunTimeStatistics(); // Print the run-time statistics.
